# Image to Orange and Blue Stencil

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/jkantner/pen/ZEEGQQg](https://codepen.io/jkantner/pen/ZEEGQQg).

To produce the best effect, the shades outputted are based on the lightness of each pixel. Since orange appears brighter, shades of orange are used if over 50% and blue if equal to or under.
